  Food accessibility has become a major concern for people during the pandemic,

    operating restaurants, and emergency food resources, to discover
    how much of an effect the pandemic has had on peopleâ€™s ability to access food,
    specifically in King County. This will give us a better understanding of the situation,
    which can help both our own communities as well as others moving forward."),
