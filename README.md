### Domain of Interest

- Why are you interested in this field/domain?

  Food accessibility has become a major concern for many people during the pandemic, even more so than before. Due to rising unemployment rates and public regulation policies, the previous stability people may have experienced with food has undoubtedly changed. We wanted to investigate the relationship between COVID-19, the number of operating restaurants, and food access points, to discover how much of an effect the pandemic has had on peopleâ€™s ability to access food, specifically in King County. This will give us a better understanding of the situation, which can help both our own communities as well as others moving forward.

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
  1) Does food accessibility (emergency or in general) have an impact on the increase or decrease of COVID-19 cases in King County?  
  2) Is there a correlation between the number of COVID cases and the number of operating restaurants in King County?
  3) Is there a correlation between the number of operating restaurants and the accessibility to emergency food resources?

### Finding Data

- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

  1) [Seattle & King County COVID Emergency Food & Meals dataset](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/COVID-Emergency-Food-and-Meals-Seattle-and-King-Co/kkzf-ntnu)

  2) [Restaurants Opened During COVID dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/restaurants-operating-during-covid19-86552)

  3) [COVID-19 in King County dataset](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/daily-summary.aspx)
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
  1) School districts and food banks routinely self-report data to the Human Services Department of Seattle on locations for COVID-19 Emergency Food and Meals. This information is updated and shared every month to enable food accessibility among King County residents.
  2) The data was compiled from publicly available sources and from self-reporting by business owners through a survey hosted by the City of Seattle.
  3) The Washington State Department of Health merges data from different laboratories, who are sent test results from testing locations. Since each location collects different information and fields may be left blank, many results will have incomplete information. This data is then cross-referenced with results from hospitals, geographic systems, and other databases to help fill in missing data. 

- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
  1) 1582 observations
  2) 2879 observations 
  3) 1417 observations (ly-counts-rates-by-geography-jan-19.csv)
  
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
  1) 14 features
  2) 12 features
  3) 13 features (ly-counts-rates-by-geography-jan-19.csv)
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  1) Where are locations in King County with higher density/more access to food sources?
     Which areas of King County have the highest density of emergency food resources? 
  2) Which location in King County has the highest number of operating restaurants?
  3) Which city has the highest death rate / infection rate?
     Which demographic has the highest death rate / infection rate?
