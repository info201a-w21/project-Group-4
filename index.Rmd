# Food accessibility has become a major concern for people during the pandemic, even more so than ever before. Due to rising unemployment and public regulation policies, the stability people may have experienced previously with food has undoubtedly changed. We wanted to investigate the relationship between COVID-19, the number of operating restaurants, and emergency food resources , to discover how much of an effect the pandemic has had on peopleâ€™s ability to access food, specifically in King County. This will give us a better understanding of the situation, which can help both our own communities as well as others moving forward.
